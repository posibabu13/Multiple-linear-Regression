# Multiple-linear-Regression
The new aspects to consider when moving from simple to multiple linear regression are as follows:  Overfitting As you keep adding variables, the model may become far too complex. It may end up memorising the training data and, consequently, fail to generalise. A model is generally said to overfit when the training accuracy is high while the test accuracy is very low. Multicollinearity This refers to associations between predictor variables, which you will study later. Feature selection Selecting an optimal set from a pool of given features, many of which might be redundant, becomes an important task.
